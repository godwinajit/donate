My goal is to support this and educate others on how they can contribute while changing lives together. Lyme has become an epidemic, and many are not aware of this disease. I want to bring awareness in many different, creative ways.      [msg2] => Being diagnosed with Lyme, whilst going through this journey has made me humble, resilient , and inspired for answers.. I welcome challenges and embrace being constructive and upfront about my experiences. The hardest thing I had to do, was let go of that control, of conquering whatever life threw at me, all by myself. Ever since I spoke-out about my disease, and chronic pain, I realized that I do not have to deal with this alone. So, I encourage others to consider sharing their diagnosis, and use their voice for support and help. This is not just about the disease itself, but about how we feel, what we need, and change. Providing education and awareness will help not just myself, but everyone far beyond our battle with Lyme Disease.
