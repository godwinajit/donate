A super easy way to automatically redirect a user to another page when viewing a post/page on your site.

== Description ==
Shortcode Redirect allows site owners to automatically redirect a user after a chosen amount of seconds when viewing a page or post on the site. The plugin instructions are very simple. Add a shortcode to the post/page that looks like the following [redirect url='http://somesite.com' sec='3'] the url= part is where you define the URL to redirect the user to and the sec= part is where you define how many seconds to wait before redirecting.

= Features =
* Works on pages and posts
* NO settings or configurations to deal with
* Define a URL to redirect the user to
* Define how many seconds to wait before re-directing the user.

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'shortcode-redirect.zip' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Add the shortcode on the pages/posts that you want to redirect. Shortcodes should look like [redirect url='http://somesite.com' sec='5'] where the url= part is the URL to redirect to, and sec= is the seconds to wait before redirecting the page.

== Note ==
Shortcode redirect should work with older versions of WordPress as well but was not tested with anything older than 2.7

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
* How do I get rid of the "Please wait while you are being re-directed..." line? - Later I will have an option for this, but for now, just edit the scr.php file and delete line 36 which contains that text then save the file.
