== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an Unbounce account? =

Yes. You need to sign up for Unbounce in order to publish pages. To publish Unbounce pages to your
Unbounce site, you will need to add a Wordpress domain in Unbounce. For example, if you Wordpress
site is available at www.example.com, you will need to add www.example.com and publish pages in
Unbounce to that domain for them to be visible on your Wordpress site.

= Do I need to log in to Unbounce? =

Yes, after installing and activating this plugin, you will need to go "Unbounce Pages" in the admin
section and click "Authorize With Unbounce." You will then be sent to Unbounce where you need to
log in. You must log in as an Unbounce user that has access to the Client that has the current
domain in Unbounce, or you will need to authorize again as an authorized user before the plugin
will function.

= Does this plugin fetch any data from Unbounce? =

Yes, this plugin will pull information from Unbounce's servers regarding which pages you have
published from Unbounce to your Wordpress site. Any pages that you have published to your Wordpress
site in Unbounce will be fetched from Unbounce's servers and displayed on your Wordpress site.
If you have a page published in Unbounce and are using the same URL for a Wordpress Page, the
Unbounce page will be displayed, not the Wordpress page.

= Does this plugin send any data to Unbounce? =

No, not by default. This plugin as an optional "debug" mode which will send diagnostic information to
Unbounce when switched on. This feature is disabled when you install the plugin. An Unbounce Customer
Success Coach may request that you turn the debug feature on if you are experiencing issues with the plugin
to help track down the issue.

= Unbounce Pages are loading, but my conversions are not being tracked =

This is typically caused by caching responses which affects how users are assigned unique identifiers.
You should add a rule to your cache to avoid caching Unbounce Pages which have the HTTP header "X-Unbounce-Plugin".
